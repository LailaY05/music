   <h2><b>What exactly is black metal?</b></h2>
                  <h3>Black metal is a genre of metal characterized by raw vocals, no real song structure, fast tempos, and poor recording quality (this is no joke). You may hear that black metal is poorly produced, and I will have to say, that yes, it kind of actually is.
                     There are many subgenres of black metal, but for now I will be telling you about first-wave, second-wave, and atmospheric black metal. 
                     First-wave bands consist of Bathory, Burzum, and Mercylful Fate. Burzum, or more specifically, Varg Vikernes, is known as the father of black metal.
                     Second-wave bands consist of Mayhem,    
                     Here's a warning for before you start listening: sadly, a lot of black metal (mainly old) is rooted in offensive themes that I will not elaborate on. I will not be showing any songs or album covers with these themes.
                  Burzum is sadly one of these bands
                  </h3>
                  <h2>So, what are some good starter albums/songs?</h2>
                  <h3>Bathory's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7DMuOFuYQbzoVgw4Cawf6L">self-titled album</a> is an excellent place to start. It's more of experimental metal, but I still consider it black metal. It was one of my first bm albums and I absolutely love the goat on the cover. By the way, don't be mistaken--it says Bathory, not Batlord. 
                  <h3>Mayhem's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2RxBdrvHKwgx57RKrNQ9hz">Deathcrush</a> is also an excellent place to start. I think that Mayhem is a lot easier to get into than Bathory (part of it being that it's less raw; it's from the second wave
              There are many other subgenres of black metal such as atmospheric bm, war metal, dungeon synth, pagan bm, symphonic bm, and other combination genres (blackgaze, doom metal (depends), blackened death metal, blackened thrash, etc). I am most familiar with atmospheric bm, dungeon synth, and the combo subgenres.
                  Atmospheric would have to be my favorite subgenre; it's often gloomy, whether it's through the actual sound or lyrics. There is not much I can show you regarding this because there are certain themes that I should not be discussing, if you understand what I mean. 
                        Throane's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2LD42z2GYmZmy1TyEfNQKG">Plus une main Ã   mordre</a> is one of my favorite atmospheric albums. I am putting a disclaimer here that I do not know what the lyrics are about or what any of it means because it's all in French (which is the only reason why I am confident in sharing this) 
                        Dungeon synth is amazing, and so is music involving synths in general, but dungeon synth is basically extremely gloomy electronic music that occasionally involved bm vocals. Erythrite Throne's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/50XvsjU08KGvtQ12c3fVE4">A Ceremonial Offering to the Black Moon</a> is my favorite dungeon synth album.
              Dungeon synth isn't a very popular genre, but you can find a lot more stuff on Bandcamp.
