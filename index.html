<h3>There are mainly two genres of metal that I listen to: black metal and death metal. These pages will just be telling you what I like and just a little bit about bm/dm in general. I just want to say that a ton of people that listen to this stuff are usually toxic, but here you are welcome to have a non-biased, non-toxic introduction to bm/dm.</h2>
<h3>I will try to avoid the more offensive and scummy parts of metal, however, figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varg_Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a> may be mentioned</h2>

      <h2><b>What exactly is death metal?</b></h2>
      <h3>Death metal is a genre of metal characterized by low-tuned guitars, deeper/lower-toned vocals, and lots of gutturals. You may know bands like Cannibal Corpse, Death or Devourment.</h>
      <h3>A lot of these bands are infamous for their disturbing themes, whether they're found in the band's name, the band's song titles, or the band's album covers. Just for your (and my grade's) sake, I will not be elaborating on such disturbing themes.</h3>
      <h3>While I don't listen to too much death metal, I do listen to a lot of <b>deathcore</b>
      <h3>Deathcore is a fusion of death metal and heavy metal, metalcore, or post-hardcore elements. It's a little difficult to explain, but think of it this way: deathcore is mostly just death metal but with breakdowns.
      <h3>Also, some deathcore vocalists like Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murder don't always use lower-toned vocals, but are still deathcore.</h3>
            <h3>So, what are some good death metal bands for starters?</h3>
            <h3>Well, as mentioned before, Death is a good band. It's not exactly death metal, but rather thrashy death metal. I recommend <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0PvGbpxBh7faAVbeZM4sIm"Scream Bloody Gore</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0WDuNDxOkxdTBwo3drhFY1">Leprosy</a>. These do NOT have typical low-toned vocals or gutturals, but it's a good place to start if you're new to this genre.
            <h3>If you want something heavier, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0c7jMSvnyfejQBM59hG2f4">Hostage</a> by Chelsea Grin is one of my all-time favorite deathcore songs. The album that it comes from is great in general, but this song is one of the best (in my opinion).
      If you want something heavier; something that's actually pure death metal, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/22d7QBsvtGYxb6imV9Lgsd">Zombie Apocalypse (this is the alternative name) by Mortician</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1T4SLs0Yxe7HmBLyVqox5T?autoplay=true">Fixated on Devastation</a> by Dying Fetus would be good places to start.
                  And yes, I am aware of the names.</h3>
