<h2>There are mainly two genres of metal that I listen to: black metal and death metal. These pages will just be telling you what I like and just a little bit about bm/dm in general. I just want to say that a ton of people that listen to this stuff are usually toxic, but here you are welcome to have a non-biased, non-toxic introduction to bm/dm.</h2>
<h2>I will try to avoid the more offensive and scummy parts of metal, however, figures like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varg_Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a> may be mentioned</h2>
