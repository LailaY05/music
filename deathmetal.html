      <h2><b>What exactly is death metal?</b></h2>
      <h3>Death metal is a genre of metal characterized by low-tuned guitars, deeper/lower-toned vocals, and lots of gutturals. You may know bands like Cannibal Corpse or Blood Incantation.</h>
      <h3>A lot of these bands are infamous for their disturbing themes, whether they're found in the band's name, the song titles, or album covers. Just for your (and my grade's) sake, I will not be elaborating on such disturbing themes.</h3>
      <hr>
      <h3>There is a subgenre of death metal called <b>deathcore</b> that I listen to a bit more than death metal.</h3>
      <h3>Deathcore is a fusion of death metal and heavy metal, metalcore, hardcore, or post-hardcore elements. It's a little difficult to explain, but think of it this way: deathcore is mostly just death metal but with breakdowns. <i>Source: A conversation I had while I was working on this project</i></h3>
      <h3>Also, some deathcore vocalists like Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murder don't always use lower-toned vocals.</h3>

            <h2>So, what are some good death metal bands for starters?</h2>
            <h3>Well, as mentioned before, Death is a good band. It's not exactly death metal, but rather thrashy death metal. I recommend <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0PvGbpxBh7faAVbeZM4sIm"Scream Bloody Gore</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0WDuNDxOkxdTBwo3drhFY1">Leprosy</a>. These do NOT have typical low-toned vocals or gutturals, but it's a good place to start if you're new to this genre.
            <h3>If you want something heavier, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/0c7jMSvnyfejQBM59hG2f4">Hostage</a> by Chelsea Grin is one of my all-time favorite deathcore songs. The album that it comes from is great in general, but this song is one of the best (in my opinion).
      If you want something heavier; something that's actually pure death metal, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/22d7QBsvtGYxb6imV9Lgsd">Zombie Apocalypse (this is the alternative name) by Mortician</a> or <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1T4SLs0Yxe7HmBLyVqox5T?autoplay=true">Fixated on Devastation</a> by Dying Fetus would be good places to start.
                  And yes, I am aware of the names.</h3>
