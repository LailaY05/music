      <h2><b>What exactly is death metal?</b></h2>
      <h3>Death metal is a genre of metal characterized by low-tuned guitars, deeper/lower-toned vocals, and lots of gutturals. You may know bands like Cannibal Corpse or Blood Incantation.</h>
      <h3>A lot of these bands are infamous for their disturbing themes, whether they're found in the band's name, the song titles, or album covers. Just for your (and my grade's) sake, I will not be elaborating on such disturbing themes.</h3>
      <hr>
      <h3>There is a subgenre of death metal called <b>deathcore</b> that I listen to a bit more than death metal.</h3>
      <h3>Deathcore is a fusion of death metal and heavy metal, metalcore, hardcore, or post-hardcore elements. It's a little difficult to explain, but think of it this way: deathcore is mostly just death metal but with breakdowns. <i>Source: A conversation I had while I was working on this project</i></h3>
      <h3>Also, some deathcore vocalists like Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murder don't always use lower-toned vocals.</h3>

      <h2>So, what are some good death metal bands for starters?</h2>
     <h3>Well, it's actually really hard to avoid certain bands that I enjoy that are school appropriate, but Belphegor is a good artist. I cannot link any albums because of how the covers look, but Belphegor is one of my favorite dm bands</h3>
     <h3>I also recommend Mortician's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/22d7QBsvtGYxb6imV9Lgsd">Zombie Apocalypse</a> (this is the alternative name). I like Mortician, but all their stuff sounds the same, so really, all you need to do if you're gonna listen to Mortician is to check out ONE of their albums. There is always some audio clip from a horror movie, usually of a girl screaming and panicking, that takes up half the song, then it's some really low-tuned guitars and long, deep gutturals. A lot of their music is also based on horror films, if you're interested.</h3>
     <h3>Dying Fetus' (yes I am well aware of the name) <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1T4SLs0Yxe7HmBLyVqox5T?autoplay=true">Fixated on Devastation</a> would also be a good song to start off frm.
