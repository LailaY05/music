      <h2><b>What exactly is death metal?</b></h2>
      <h3>Death metal is a genre of metal characterized by low-tuned guitars, deeper/lower-toned vocals, and lots of gutturals. You may know bands like Cannibal Corpse or Blood Incantation.</h>
      <h3>A lot of these bands are infamous for their disturbing themes, whether they're found in the band's name, the song titles, or album covers. Just for your (and my grade's) sake, I will not be elaborating on such disturbing themes.</h3>
      <hr>
      <h3>There is a subgenre of death metal called <b>deathcore</b> that I listen to a bit more than death metal.</h3>
      <h3>Deathcore is a fusion of death metal and heavy metal, metalcore, hardcore, or post-hardcore elements. It's a little difficult to explain, but think of it this way: deathcore is mostly just death metal but with breakdowns. <i>Source: A conversation I had while I was working on this project</i></h3>
      <h3>Also, some deathcore vocalists like Trevor Strnad of The Black Dahlia Murder don't always use lower-toned vocals.</h3>

      <h2>So, what are some good death metal bands for starters?</h2>
     <h3>Well, it's actually really hard to avoid certain bands that I enjoy that are school appropriate (there is no such thing as a normal band), but Belphegor is a good artist. I cannot link any albums because of how the covers look, but Belphegor is one of my favorite dm bands</h3>
     <h3>I also recommend Mortician's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/22d7QBsvtGYxb6imV9Lgsd">Zombie Apocalypse</a> (this is the alternative name). I like Mortician, but all their stuff sounds the same, so really, all you need to do if you're gonna listen to Mortician is to check out ONE of their albums. There is always some audio clip from a horror movie, usually of a girl screaming and panicking, that takes up half the song, then it's some really low-tuned guitars and long, deep gutturals. A lot of their music is also based on horror films, if you're interested.</h3>
     <h3>Dying Fetus' (yes I am well aware of the name) <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1T4SLs0Yxe7HmBLyVqox5T?autoplay=true">Fixated on Devastation</a> would also be a good song to start off of, but I'll be honest, even I didn't really like the song that much at first.</h3>

      <h2>Well, I don't like death metal, and you said that you liked deathcore; what are some good songs?</h2>
      <h3> Great question. I absolutely love deathcore.</h3>
      <h3>Angelmaker's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/27uufl6AVc4WOxpFA2fB4I">Dissentient</a> is an amazing album. Their self-titled is also amazing. Leech is my favorite song (and probably everyone else's) off of this album.</h3>
      <h3>Lorna Shore's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6NHzRTTezYzI2ET4I3MMLb">Immortal</a> is another amazing album. Sadly the vocalist was kicked out, but he has more music from a band he was previously in called <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0yxJx8OEyDfd7dzLsFuNrS">Signs of the Swarm</a>. My favorite song off Immortal would be This is Hell and my favorite SOTS song would be <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/1eJvRMKeEZIF2EugUsr5oq">Cesspool of Ignorance</a></h3>
      <h3>Enterprise Earth's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/5BC9EPMZgYE9QCAQhFZCVz">Reanimate // Disintegrate</a> (this is just a song, not an album) is amazing. It's a part of their upcoming album titled, 'The Chosen'. I plan on seeing them in January and I'm incredibly excited. I love the riffs.</h3>
      <h3>Carnifex's <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2a438TPhWUKXhfiYdgH07V">Dead in my Arms</a> is a classic deathcore album. I cannot name my favorite song sadly, nor my favorite thing about it (well I can; it's the bridge), but it's still a great album nonetheless</h3>
